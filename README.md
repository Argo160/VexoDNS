## ✨ Key Features

* **Subscription Dashboard:** Instantly view your:
    * 👤 **Username**
    * 📊 **Subscription Status** (Active, Expired, Limited, Disabled)
    * ⏱️ **Time Remaining**
    * 💾 **Volume Remaining**
    * 🌐 **Last Registered IP**
* **Automatic IP Registration:** Automatically detects your public IP and registers it with your subscription on refresh. It informs you if your IP is new, unchanged, or if there's a conflict.
* **One-Click DNS Service:**
    * **🛡️ Connect DNS:** Instantly starts a local Android `VpnService` to route all your device's DNS queries through the secure Plain DNS (Do53) provided by your subscription.
    * **✅ Disconnect DNS:** Stops the `VpnService` and reverts all DNS settings back to your network's default.
* **Multi-Language Support:** Full UI translation for:
    * 🇬🇧 **English**
    * 🇮🇷 **Farsi (فارسی)**
    * 🇷🇺 **Russian (Русский)**
    * 🇨🇳 **Chinese (中文)**
* **Persistent Settings:** Remembers your last-used subscription link, language, and connection preference.
* **Smart Timer:** If your IP changes, the app waits 60 seconds (as required by the panel) before automatically attempting to connect, ensuring the new IP is fully registered.
